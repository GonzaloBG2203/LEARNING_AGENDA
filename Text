Finished Ubuntu ROS 2 Humble tutorial (actually, a review), with minor problems. Great performance compared to Windows ROS 2 Humble tutorial.
Reviewing the tutorial in Ubuntu granted confidence using Ubuntu´s terminal and OS overall. Great features compared to Windows´s terminal, for example: simple feature like multiple termina tabs is super useful.
Finished tutorial and overview of Gazebo standalone in Ubuntu. Very intuitive and straightforward.
